TODO
  need build process in which client gets deployed

server
  http basic auth protected route
    on auth success starts a transaction with a ttl and an id
    renders form with instructions for running a shell script
    shell script is rendered based on the transaction id
      shell script downloads the binary
      shell script runs the binary with the id and some other vars (ip address)

client
  packs up the image
  gets a checksum of the image
  pings server
  if checksum is not recognized
    gets s3 bucket to place in from server
    uploads to s3 bucket
    pings server with transaction id when done
  waits for s3 identifier

server
  imports the image into docker naming it after identifier
  starts container
  runs scripts
  saves image
  puts new image into s3
  tells client about image in s3

client
  pulls down s3 image
